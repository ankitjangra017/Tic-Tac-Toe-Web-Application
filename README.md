# Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application

This project is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to enter their names, take turns playing the game, and displays the winner or if the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- **Player Names:** Players can enter their names before starting the game.
- **Turn-Based Gameplay:** The game alternates turns between the two players.
- **Win Detection:** The game checks for a win condition after each move.
- **Draw Detection:** The game checks if all cells are filled without a winner, resulting in a draw.
- **Restart Game:** Players can restart the game at any time.
